DOCSCOPE COPILOT - ANALYSIS SUMMARY
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis evaluated 22 AI documentation artifacts against 8 governance categories 
using evidence-based keyword matching and structural analysis.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. EQUITY CRISIS: Only 9/22 documents include quantitative fairness 
   metrics. 10 documents have no equity coverage whatsoever.

2. CRITICAL GAPS: Identified 0 critical and 5 high-priority documentation 
   gaps across safety, equity, and training data categories.

3. FRAMEWORK-PRACTICE GAP: Significant divergence between what documentation frameworks recommend 
   and what organizations actually disclose.

4. ENFORCEMENT OPPORTUNITY: Standardized, machine-readable documentation formats could enable 
   automated compliance checking for procurement and regulation.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:

- Mandating structured documentation with minimum coverage thresholds is technically feasible
- Equity metrics should be elevated to mandatory disclosure requirements
- Current voluntary approaches are insufficient for governance needs
