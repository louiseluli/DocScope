  "executive_summary": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis analysis evaluated 22 AI documentation artifacts against 8 governance categories \nusing evidence-based keyword matching, structural analysis, and novel content quality detection.\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n\n1. EQUITY CRISIS: Only 9/22 documents include quantitative fairness \n   metrics. 10 documents have no equity coverage whatsoever.\n\n2. CRITICAL GAPS: Identified 0 critical and 5 high-priority documentation \n   gaps across safety, equity, and training data categories.\n\n3. FRAMEWORK-PRACTICE GAP: Significant divergence between what documentation frameworks recommend \n   and what organizations actually disclose.\n\n4. QUALITY CRISIS (NEW FINDING): Automated quality detection reveals artifact documentation quality \n   score of 0.537/1.0, with quality gap of -0.537 compared to frameworks.\n   Many artifacts contain promotional language rather than substantive technical content.\n\n5. ENFORCEMENT OPPORTUNITY: Standardized, machine-readable documentation formats with automated \n   quality checks could enable compliance monitoring for procurement and regulation.\n\nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS:\n\n- Mandating structured documentation with minimum coverage AND quality thresholds is technically feasible\n- Equity metrics should be elevated to mandatory disclosure requirements\n- Promotional language detection can distinguish marketing claims from verifiable specifications\n- Current voluntary approaches are insufficient for governance needs",
